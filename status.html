	<strong>david</strong> <small>June 4th, 2016 8:18am</small> <p><p>Got a new mouse, a Microsoft Wireless 1850, for a bit more than ten dollars. I am amazed they can make and sell them for so cheap.</p> <p>  It is replacing my older model Microsoft wireless mouse which has lasted me 5 years. The new one has a solidbody design, it is nice and clicky, and has a fairly decent range. <p> Although it still requires a USB reciever, which is one of the reasons I would like to find a nice reasonably priced bluetooth mouse, one I could potentally use with my Android devices.</p></p>
